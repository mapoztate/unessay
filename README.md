## What is evolution, and how does it occur?
Have you ever wondered how animals share a common ancestor, yet somehow manage to be so different from one another? The answer lies in **evolution**, a process in which various species develop various features because of their environment. However, these developments happen in various methods, often known as the four forces of evolution. They are: *genetic drift*, *gene flow*, *natural selection*, and *mutation*. 

This website will guide you toward explaining these four forces of evolution in a simple manner, skipping the specific terminology and giving you a general overview, provided with visuals to solidify your understanding.

<h2 href="#genetic-drift">Genetic Drift </h2>
Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies during meiosis. More specifically, the allelle has two choices: be lost or fixed. It is most noticable observing at the macro scale, since each generation has different frequencies being passed on.

Genetic drift can occur in two different ways: the **founder effect** and **genetic bottleneck**.

<h3>Founder effect </h3>
The founder effect happens when a population spreads to a new area, but since it's a smaller sample, it has less genetic diversity compared to the original range of the previous population.
A good way to remember the founder effect is that the population that migrates are the "founders" of that community within that geographic region.

A real life situation of this would be royal inbreeding. In an attempt to keep the bloodline pure, royalty often had problems mating with their own family. Hemophilia was particularly prevalent within the British Royal Family. While these symptoms would have a small chance to appear in large populations, because the sample size is so small, the change of receiving the specific trait is amplified.

<h3>Genetic bottleneck </h3>
Reduction in population may leave survivors with certain traits to produce a new generation in which has traits drastically reduced because original variety is dead

Examples: disaster wipes animals which reduces it

<h2 href="#gene-flow">Gene Flow</h2>
Migration.

When two species have different allele frequencies get together, and mix the allele variants within each other
become more similar over time but increases variation

greatest factor is geograpical distance

Example: humans travelling overseas dating. mixed race

Movement of alleles from population to another


<h2 href="#natural-selection">Natural Selection </h2>
Acting upon variation
Will allow certain individuals to sruvive and will be passed down upon aka fitness
Cannot produce new traits, only picks what is already in environment
Those best adapted will live longest and reproduce

happens when things changwe

patterns:
* going for the mean: stabilizing
searching for the middle ground, weight: cannot be heavy or light
* picking one direction
moths with light or dark depending on environment
*disruptive 

types of natural selection
sexual selection: females chose males and males pcik certain traits which pref

Is similar, but that genetic bottleneck is random, while natural selection is due to specific traits

<h2 href="#mutation">Mutation </h2>
* New development of new allele, only source
* Rare and random with gametes 
* Can be positive, negative, neutral
* Mutation occurs with amino acids in DNA, mistake in acids

Can occur in different methods

Point mutation
accidentally substituted one for another which produces different protein

Frameshift mutation
Does not substitute, instead adds additional letter and shifts other letters which affects everything else

Transposable elements - copies into different places in DNA sequences depending on insertion
Chromosomal mutation - extra/missing chromosomes due to meiosis

Spontaneous mutation has no known causes
Can also be induced by environmental agents, or toxic chemicals/ radiation, happens during lifetime
ex:

While many mutations have no effects, there are also positive mutations
plague, had mutation which resisted disease, can also be resistant to HIV
