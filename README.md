## What is evolution, and how does it occur?
Have you ever wondered how animals share a common ancestor, yet somehow manage to be so different from one another? The answer lies in **evolution**, a process in which various species develop various features because of their environment. 

However, these developments happen in various methods, often known as the four forces of evolution. They are: genetic drift, mutation, gene flow, and natural selection.
